Deployed to Heroku -> [App](https://gen-express.herokuapp.com/)  

Initialized with `express-generator` (updated all packages afterwards). This is roughly based on MDN's express [LocalLibrary](https://github.com/mdn/express-locallibrary-tutorial/tree/master) but has cookie-based authentication and authorization implemented.

## Local development setup

1. Install MongoDB and create a local_library database
2. Run `npm i` in the project root

### Run

For windows:

```
npm run windev
```

For mac/linux:
